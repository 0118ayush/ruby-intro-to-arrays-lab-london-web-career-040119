# Introduction To Arrays Lab

## Objectives
1. Become comfortable with instantiating arrays in different ways
2. Become comfortable using indexes to return values from an array
3. Become comfortable using ruby methods to traverse an array
4. Become comfortable using the official documentation of the Ruby Language

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository. Then run `bundle install` in your command line to install the rspec and pry gems. 
2. Run the test suite with the `learn` command in your command line. 
3. The first set of tests will require you to build methods that instantiate and return arrays. Read the spec file to learn what is required of you and get the tests passing. 
4. The second set of tests requires you to use indexing to access certain array elements. Read the spec file to learn what is required of you and get the tests passing. 
5. The third and final set of tests requires you to use array methods to access array elements and preform other operations on arrays. Read the spec file to learn what is required of you and get the tests passing.
